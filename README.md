# AuthApp1

AuthApp1 is a Flutter authentication client that integrates with AWS Cognito through Amplify.  
This document captures the steps required to stand up the Amplify environment and wire the app to your Cognito user pool.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.7.0 or newer (`flutter --version` to confirm)
- Node.js 20+ (aligns with the latest Amplify CLI overrides tooling)
- AWS CLI configured with an IAM user/role that can create Cognito resources (`aws configure`)
- Amplify CLI (`npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`)
- Xcode (for iOS) and/or Android Studio SDK/NDK (for Android)

## 1. Clone & bootstrap the repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd authapp1
flutter pub get
```

## 2. Configure Amplify backend
1. Initialize Amplify in the project root:
   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```
   - Choose **Flutter** as the default editor, enable iOS/Android (and Web if needed), then pick your AWS profile.

2. Add the Cognito auth resource:
   ```bash
   amplify add auth
   ```
   - Select **Walkthrough all the auth configurations** so you can set email + phone sign-in and update password policy/MFA as needed.

3. Deploy the baseline backend:
   ```bash
   amplify push
   ```
   - This provisions the Cognito User Pool/Identity Pool and uploads the generated configuration to S3.

4. Pull the updated backend metadata locally:
   ```bash
   amplify pull
   ```
   - This refreshes `amplify/backend/auth/*/cli-inputs.json`, `parameters.json`, and `team-provider-info.json` so the repo reflects the console changes.

## 3. Update the Flutter config
1. Copy the generated values from `amplify/team-provider-info.json` or `amplify/backend/amplify-meta.json` into `lib/amplifyconfiguration.dart`.  
   Replace the placeholder strings:
   ```json
   "PoolId": "us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX",
   "AppClientId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "Region": "us-east-1",
   "cognito_identity_pool_id": "us-east-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
2. For apps with an App Client secret disabled (recommended for native apps), remove the `AppClientSecret` property completely.
3. Confirm that the Cognito app client exposes `email`, `phone_number`, and the verification flags; if you make changes later, rerun `amplify pull` and update this file again.

## 4. Platform-specific setup
### iOS
- In `ios/Runner/Info.plist` add the following keys if missing:
  ```xml
  <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Used to enable biometric sign-in.</string>
  <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Used for authentication analytics.</string>
  ```
- Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` after any dependency changes.

### Android
- Ensure `android/app/build.gradle.kts` sets `minSdk = 23` (required by `local_auth` and Amplify).
- If using biometric auth, confirm `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` includes:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
  ```

## 5. Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```
- The splash screen configures Amplify automatically; on success, you should land on the login screen. Accounts are provisioned centrally—use the username/password provided by your administrator. First-time users will be prompted to set a new password and confirm their contact details.

## 6. Managing environments
- Use `amplify env add` to create additional AWS environments (e.g., dev/stage/prod).
- Pull backend updates from teammates with `amplify pull`.
- After backend changes, confirm `lib/amplifyconfiguration.dart` reflects the latest values.

## 7. Runtime configuration
- Authentication rules (email/phone regex, password length, default Remember Me) are centralized in `lib/config/app_environment.dart`.
- Select an environment at runtime with `--dart-define APP_ENV=<dev|staging|prod>`, e.g.:
  ```bash
  flutter run --dart-define APP_ENV=staging
  ```
  Each environment overrides the `AuthConfig` provided through Riverpod so future apps can tailor policies without touching UI code.

## 8. Useful commands
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `amplify status` | Shows categories to be deployed |
| `amplify console auth` | Opens the Cognito console in a browser |
| `amplify push` | Deploys the local backend changes |
| `amplify pull --restore` | Restores backend environment configuration |

## 9. Troubleshooting
- **Amplify not configured**: Ensure `_AmplifyBootstrapper.ensureConfigured()` runs before `runApp` (already handled in `lib/main.dart`).
- **`AmplifyAlreadyConfiguredException`**: Safe to ignore; the app protects against double configuration.
- **Biometric sign-in fails**: Check that `local_auth` is correctly configured per platform and that the device supports biometrics.
- **Widgets tests failing**: Update or remove the default `widget_test.dart`; it still references the counter template.
- **`NotAuthorizedException: attempted to write unauthorized attribute`**: Typically appears if an admin disables the required attributes in Cognito. Re-enable email/phone updates (or remove them from the client permissions) and run `amplify pull`.

- **Styling tweaks**: Update `lib/theme/app_theme.dart` for shared colors, typography, and spacing. Auth screens reuse `AuthScaffold` (`lib/theme/layout/auth_layout.dart`) so downstream apps can swap themes without rewriting forms.
- **CI/CD templates**: Use the provided workflows:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` – main branch validation (format, analyze, test, Android release build).
  - `.github/workflows/cd-android.yml` – manual deploy template with keystore + Play Store placeholders.
  - `.github/workflows/cd-ios.yml` – manual deploy template with signing asset placeholders.

## 10. Security controls
- **Device attestation**: The app blocks rooted/jailbroken, emulator, and mock-location devices (see `safe_device` checks in `lib/state/security_controller.dart`). For development builds (`flutter run`), the guard is relaxed; release builds enforce it.
- **OS passcode/biometric enforcement**: On launch/resume the session gate (`lib/security/security_gate.dart`) requires LocalAuth to succeed with biometric or device passcode. Devices without a secure lock screen are rejected with remediation guidance.
- **Idle session lock**: User interaction is monitored via `InactivityGuard`; after two minutes of inactivity the session locks and re-prompts for authentication. Backgrounding the app immediately locks the session.
- **Sign-out fallback**: When access is blocked or the user can’t re-authenticate, the security screen offers a managed sign-out that clears local credentials while preserving “Remember me” preference.
- **Operational checklist**: Pair these client controls with MDM enforcement, Cognito MFA, audit logging, and incident response policies before handling PHI in production.
- **Profile settings**: The in-app profile only exposes password rotation and security PIN management; email/phone changes and contact verification remain administrator workflows in Cognito.

## 11. User provisioning
- **Create users centrally** using the Cognito console, CLI (`amplify auth add-user`), or AdminCreateUser API. Supply email and phone so preprovisioned accounts match the app’s required attributes.
- **Distribute temporary credentials** to clinicians and require them to set a new password at first login. The app already handles the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge during sign-in.
- **Contact verification**: First login triggers an email/SMS code challenge; the home screen also reminds users to verify their contact info until both email and phone are confirmed. Administrators can resend verification codes from Cognito if needed.
- **Profile updates**: Clinicians can change their Cognito password from the Profile screen and set/reset the app security PIN; all other profile edits (name, title, contact changes) are handled centrally by administrators.
- **Disable self sign-up** in Cognito (no Hosted UI) and keep the app’s self-registration UI hidden, ensuring only pre-authorized staff receive access.

For deeper customization, review the official docs:
- [Amplify Flutter Auth Guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/auth/)
- [AWS Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html)

With Amplify and Cognito configured, continue iterating on the UI, state management, and API integrations as needed. Happy building!
